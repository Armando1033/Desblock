without the need for root. Enjoy the use of your Android without a lock screen when your Pebble watch, selected
Bluetooth devices or Wifi networks are connected and the security of a lock screen when you walk away causing
your Pebble, other Bluetooth devices or Wifi networks to disconnect.

Available on the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lukekorth.pebblelocker)
